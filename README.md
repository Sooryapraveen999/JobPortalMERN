The Job Portal is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that connects job seekers with employers. It provides APIs and UIs for creating, listing, and applying to jobs. Employers (admins) can post and manage job listings, while job seekers (users) can browse jobs, submit applications, and track application status. This mirrors real-world job sites: “employers are given tools to post, manage, and fill their job openings, while job seekers [can] search for roles, apply for positions, and manage their application status”. The backend is an Express.js API server that interacts with MongoDB via Mongoose; the frontend is built with React (using React Router for navigation).

Tech Stack: The project uses Node.js with Express.js to build a RESTful API. MongoDB (via Mongoose) stores persistent data (users, jobs, applications). Authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Role-based access control (RBAC) distinguishes Admin vs User permissions. The React frontend communicates with these APIs, sending the JWT in request headers for protected actions.

Real-World Use: In production, this portal could serve companies for recruiting or act as a simple job board. It demonstrates common enterprise features: authentication, authorization, CRUD operations, and client-server interaction. For example, as Soorya Praveen notes, a job portal allows dynamic job search, detailed job views, and application management for seekers, and secure job posting and application review for employers
